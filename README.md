## Introduction
- Low power and area efficient technologies are the prime concern for VLSI system designers. Together with that, the high speed binary to Gray code converter that use low power consumption have indisputably become one of the most crucial components of a processor because they are mostly used in arithmetic logic unit. Transmission gates require lower switching energy and it reduces the count of transistors used to make different logic gates. Transmission gate use less area and less transistors compare with conventional design logic.In this project I have designed and simulated the binary to Gray code converter using transmission gates. the design and Implementation will be done using eSim and ngspice software
- .BINARY TO GRAY CODE CONVERTER--
 This code converter combinational circuit is designed to convert binary to Gray code. The input code of code converter is binary and output code of code converter is Gray code.
